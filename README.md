# Mobile-Price-Prediction
I have developed a Mobile Price Prediction model utilizing various Machine Learning algorithms. This project aims to classify mobile devices into different price ranges, categorized from 0 to 3, based on the dataset. To achieve this, I have trained a mobile price classification model using three distinct ML algorithms. The model determines the price range of a mobile device by analyzing multiple parameters, including camera specifications, touchscreen capability, number of processing cores, battery performance, clock speed, internal memory, and battery capacity. Following the training phase, I conducted a comparative analysis of the three algorithms using graphical representations to evaluate their effectiveness
